### Introduction to nbgrader: Create and deploy assignments

[nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io) is an application for creating, deploying and grading assignments with Jupyter notebook. We will learn how to create assignments with nbgrader and how to write meaningful tests with feedback to evaluate student code.

### Introduction to nbgrader: Grade and return assignments

The magic of nbgrader is the autograding! Evaluate student code and give feedback automatically. But there's a catch... we need to write a custom Python script to move student submissions into the nbgrader folders and then we need another script to reassemble the graded notebooks for uploading back to Canvas. It can be done and it will fun!
