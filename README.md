## August 12 - 14, 2020

[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) is a web application for producing computational narratives: a notebook in the browser which runs code and renders text, mathematical notation, images and videos. Jupyter notebook is a powerful open source tool for scientific computing and reproducible research.

Come join other instructors, researchers and students at UBC to share their Jupyter experiences and to learn about new Jupyter tools!

## Instructor Instructions

For instructors wishing to add their workshop content to this Jupyter Book:

- Please upload content as `.md` files or `.ipynb` files to the [jupyterdays/content/](jupyterdays/content) directory of this repository (you will find some example files already included in that directory for reference).
- You will also need to update the book's table of contents to include your new files - do this by adding your files to the toc structure in the [jupyterdays/_toc.yml](jupyterdays/_toc.yml) file.
- If your added content includes executable code (e.g., a `.ipynb` file), please include any dependencies to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
- The book will be rebuilt and deployed automatically. Please tag @TomasBeuzen in your commit or in an issue in the repository when you push changes.
