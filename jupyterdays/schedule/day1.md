### Deploy course content with nbgitpuller and Syzygy

[nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/) allows instructors to share Jupyter notebooks with students in a single click! We will complete a full example from start to finish: create a repository on GitHub, create Jupyter notebooks, push to GitHub, create a nbgitpuller link to Syzygy and share!
