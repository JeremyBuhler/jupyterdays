    "\n",
    "Canvas is current course management system used by UBC. We can keep the student experience with other courses at UBC consistent by using Canvas as the pointer to our course materials that we host on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) (a remote version control web archive). From the students perspective, nothing appears much different from their other courses and so there is no unnecessary cognitive load added for them to learn a new system.\n",

    "Why use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) for hosting materials? Well [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) is a remote version control web archive that allows you to view the history of your files, track who made changes to which files, use issue tracking to log and assign course/assignment bugs for fixing, or new features to add. Additionally, it is an authentic data science tool used in industry and academia.\n",
